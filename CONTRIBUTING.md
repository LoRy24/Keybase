## Code style
In order to edit the code, you should follow the following scheme. Note that everything should be documented (only the functions, not the inside) and you cannot edit
only the style of the source.

```java

/**
 * Test Class
 *
 * @author Lorenzo Rocca
 */
public class Test {
  public void testFunction(String param) {
    System.out.println("Easy Code!");
  }
}
```
